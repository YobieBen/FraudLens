### Important Notes:
- **DO NOT** use your regular Gmail password - it won't work
- The App Password is different from your Gmail password
- You can revoke App Passwords anytime from your Google Account
- Each App Password can only be viewed once when created

### Troubleshooting:
- If connection fails, make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Check that you're using the App Password, not your regular password
- Make sure IMAP is enabled in Gmail settings:
  - Go to Gmail Settings â†’ See all settings â†’ Forwarding and POP/IMAP
  - Enable IMAP access

### Security:
- App Passwords are secure and limited in scope
- They can only access the specific service (email in this case)
- You can revoke them anytime from your Google Account
- FraudLens only reads emails, never modifies or deletes them
